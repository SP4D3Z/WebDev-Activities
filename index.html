    <br>
    <pre>
        When I hear the word life I only think of one thing, and that is to live to do something meaningful. 
        I want to live my life where I can develop my character to its finest that I can be proud of. 
        I also want to live a life where I can develop relationships, because relationships are important 
        and can be used to make the world a better place.</pre>
